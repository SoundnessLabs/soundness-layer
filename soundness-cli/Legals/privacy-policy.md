# **Privacy Policy for `Sound_Game` Discord Bot**

**Effective Date:** July 24, 2025
This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, and handling of personal information by the `Sound_Game` Discord bot with application ID, `1398771862791786528`, developed by **Soundness Labs LTD** (“we”, “our”, or “us”). By using `Sound_Game`, you agree to the terms described below.

### **Information We Collect**
When you interact with `Sound_Game`, we may collect and process the following data to enable a leaderboard for the testnet launch:

* **Discord user data**: your Discord user ID, username, server ID, and interaction metadata (e.g., when you start or complete a game).
* **Usage data**: time of interactions, frequency of bot usage, game session completion logs.
* **Web session metadata** (during game and ZK proof generation): browser fingerprinting or IP address (used only temporarily to serve web-based components securely).
* **Zero-knowledge proof inputs/outputs**: which are cryptographically structured and cannot be used to directly identify users.

We do **not** collect message content or store any unnecessary personal data.

### **How We Use Your Information**
We use the information we collect to:
* Operate the `Sound_Game` bot and enable core functionality.
* Redirect users to web-based experiences and track session state (e.g., game completion).
* Support zero-knowledge proof generation workflows and verify submissions to our decentralized infrastructure.
* Sending the results as a direct message to the user to make sure no personal information will be shared in public channels.
* Monitor bot performance, detect abuse, and improve system reliability during the testnet.

Your data will **never** be used for advertising or sold to third parties.

### **Sharing Your Information**
We do **not** sell, rent, or trade your information. We may only disclose your information:
* To comply with legal obligations or valid legal requests (e.g., court orders).
* To protect the rights, property, or safety of Soundness Labs, our users, or others.
Where possible, data is anonymized or pseudonymized before any analysis.

### **Data Retention**

We retain your data:
* Only for the duration of the Soundness Layer testnet unless otherwise stated.
* ZK proof metadata is stored separately on Walrus Data Storage and is not linkable to personal identifiers.
* You may request deletion of your data by contacting us (see below), and we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.


### **Data Security**
We take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to protect your information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access. These include:

* Encrypted storage
* Role-based internal access controls
* HTTPS and secure session protocols

However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

### **Your Rights**
If you are located in the EU, UK, or similar jurisdictions, you may have the right to:

* Access the personal data we hold about you
* Request correction or deletion
* Withdraw consent to processing (where applicable)

To exercise your rights, please contact: [privacy@soundnesslayer.xyz](mailto:privacy@soundnesslayer.xyz)
