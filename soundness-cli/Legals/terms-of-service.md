* Exploit, interfere with, or reverse-engineer the Bot or its connected systems.
* Use the Bot for any commercial purpose, spam, abuse, or disruptive behavior.
* Attempt to link identities to ZK proof data in violation of user privacy.

### 3. Limitation of Liability
The Bot Owner shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from:

* The use or inability to use the Bot
* Errors or interruptions in service
* Any breach of data, even if anonymized

The Bot is provided “as is” as part of a community testnet with no performance or uptime guarantees.

### 4. Modifications to the Bot
The Bot Owner may modify, suspend, or terminate the Bot or related services at any time without notice. The User agrees that the Bot Owner shall not be liable for any changes or interruptions.

### 5. Intellectual Property

### 6. Indemnification
The User agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Soundness Labs, its affiliates, contributors, and representatives from any and all claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising from the User’s misuse of the Bot or violation of this Agreement.

### 7. Termination
This Agreement may be terminated by either party at any time. Upon termination, the User must immediately stop using the Bot and all connected services.

### 8. Governing Law
